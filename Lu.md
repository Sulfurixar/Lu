# Lu

In the perspective of Lu practitioners, all of the world is composed of a form of energy that is referred to as Lu.

Lu, as a state of energy, contains the information that composes the world (Zaak). Those who wield Lu are able to manipulate it and make the world itself bend and change to their desire as long as they know how to.

The composition of a Lu command follows a three step process:
	1) Composition of the Idea Space ([[Lor Space]]);
	2) Composition of an Instruction Sequence in the Instruction Space ([[Mindovaak Space]]);
	3) Execution in the Execution Space ([[Dreh Space]]).

As given from the description, each process takes place in a different [[Zaak Space]]; each with their own name. The Lu practitioner imagines what they want to accomplish and projects their imagination into the Lor. From there, they expand their Lor into fundamental concepts of the world and direct it to the Mindovaat. In the Mindovaat the expanded Lor is actually used to transcribe the sequence. Upon the completion of the Mindovaat, the sequence is executed in the Dreh Space which overlays the Zaak to be overwritten in the world with the Zaak produced from the Mindovaak.

All of these spaces are typically aligned as such that the Lor could be extracted from the practitioner's brain.

None of the [[Zaak Space|Zaak Spaces]] ([[Lor Space]], [[Mindovaak Space]], [[Dreh Space]]) are perceivable with the five senses.

# Countering Lu
There are ways to counter Lu commands as well as the restorative interference of the world itself.

# Ranking and Classification
Lu practitioners are separated into different classes of ranking based on their proficiencies and comprehension of Lu. Read more from [[Classes]].
