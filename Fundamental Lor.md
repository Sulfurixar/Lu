# Fundamental Lor
A type of Lor that approaches the root of the world so far down that it cannot be simplified any further.

Fundamental Lor is a type of Lor that can be defined by only itself and has no other Lor that could define it other than itself. For a more intuitive understanding, imagine if Fundamental Lor are Prime Numbers and how they cannot be constructed from multiplying other numbers (Compound Numbers).
