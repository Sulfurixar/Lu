# Interference
When two Lu commands interject in the world, they begin to experience a sort of interference effect. Typically this end in the overwriting Zaak in the area, turning into senseless noise, and thus having no effect on the world.

This is by far the most common way of interfering with a Lu command, as it's more common (albeit still incredibly rare) for a Lu practitioner just try to cast their own Lu command in the same location than to be able to catch and perceive the location where a Lu command is being compiled at before its completion.

Whether a practitioner is able to interfere with the Zaak successfully depends on their own Interference power. 

Overwritten Zaak is not permanent. The world itself has a restorative effect on its Zaak, which makes it so one cannot use Lu a single time and expect the effect of their Lu command to be everlasting in some cases. For example, one could use Lu to overwrite the Zaak in an area that governs gravity and increase it. For a while, depending on the interference strength that a Lu practitioner has, it will stay higher, but eventually gravity would be restored to normal - forcing the practitioner to recast their Lu.
