# Grimoires
Lu practitioners typically use assistive tools to channel their imagined result into the [[Lor Space]] such that it would actually break down into [[Fundamental Lor]].

Due to the sheer complexity of understanding a [[Fundamental Lor]], an assistive tool that contains and stores [[Fundamental Lor]] in it is often required, as the practitioner themselves has not yet grasped them and the complete pathway that using them makes into the image they had in mind.

One of the methods to store [[Fundamental Lor]] and [[Compound Lor]] is by writing it down into a Grimoire. Grimoires, traditionally, look like books, but they can also come in the form of talismans, seer stones, etc. A Grimoire embodies the things that it stores, this is why it is possible to use them as the container for Lor. Typically every Lu practitioner owns a Grimoire of their own to store their own research, whilst using a handed down Grimoire to supplement their knowledge.

Grimoires are normally organized to a single [[Lu Archive]], but a more advanced practitioner could also have a Grimoires that contain [[Thema]]s from multiple [[Lu Archive]]s.

# Legendary Grimoires
Grimoires that have been worked on for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years typically start approaching the [[Truth of The World]], to the point that a Grimoire can actually become sentient. Such Grimoires, that have a will of their own, will instead choose those who they work with and can choose which [[Fundamental Lor]] they allow their partner to access. In this way, it can be to the detriment to whoever chooses to use such a Grimoire, since they can't access the full of contents of it, but despite this it is more common that practitioners who got their hands on a Legendary Grimoire display a far more complicated and powerful hold over the Zaak.

Some especially advanced Grimoires of this type can take any form according to their own image. Even further, one such Grimoire gained the ability to exert its own will to the Zaak, making it a Lu practitioner of immense power itself.
