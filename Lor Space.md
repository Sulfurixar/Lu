# Lor Space - Idea Space
Lor Space, also known as the Idea space, is where [[Compound Lor]] (Complex Lor) is sent and arranged for decoding. The more [[Fundamental Lor]] is used in this process, the faster the decoding process in the [[Mindovaak Space]] is later, but due to the sheer amount of Lor needed to be kept in focus by the Lu practitioner, can get very taxing on their mind very quickly.
