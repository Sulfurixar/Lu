# Themas
Themas are, as name applies, themes contained within a type of [[Lu Archive|Archive]]. For a practitioner, learning the entirety of the contents in an [[Lu Archive|Archive]] (which are seemingly endless in their contents) is not viable. That's why they pick a Thema related to an [[Lu Archive|Archive]]  and start specializing in that Thema. 

A Thema describes one topic from the [[Lu Archive|Archive]] Type. 

For example, a Thema from [[Tolaan/Luxuria (Desire)|Tolaan]] would be desire related. 

A practitioner might want to pick a Thema from [[Tolaan/Luxuria (Desire)|Tolaan]] because they don't have many expectations or desire towards things going their way. From there, if they want to understand the desire for destroying everything, returning everything to nothingness, they may start researching that Thema, and become proficient in Lu commands that do exactly that - reduce all to nothing. 

From [[Virtue Type Archives]] they might pick [[Drem/Concordia (Harmony)|Drem]] because they don't experience conflict in life and are in harmony with who they are, a sense of fulfillment, perhaps. As for the Thema, they might pick something to do with keeping things in harmony, such as Lu that makes people act according to your will.

It is to note, that Themas of similar effect can occur in multiple [[Lu Archive|Archives]], but the difference is the application of the Thema. For example, a practitioner could learn to manipulate the emotions of people from both [[Kah/Superbia (Pride)|Kah]] and [[Drem/Concordia (Harmony)|Drem]]. From [[Kah/Superbia (Pride)|Kah]] they might've picked Imperium, which is about ruling and controlling. Whilst from [[Drem/Concordia (Harmony)|Drem]] one could pick Influentia, which they could use to rule and control.

A Thema is a single Lu command (with minor variations in execution) that achieves the effect of what its name implies. As such, a Thema is divided into spells of similar effect.
