# Jamming

Due to the Lor being aligned to the caster, it is possible to interfere with a Lu command before it is even constructed by interfereing with the [[Lor Space]]. However, this requires the Lor not to have been directed to the Mindovaat Space yet. Through, for most Lu practitioners this is not a viable method simply due to how fast Lor is constructed by your typical practitioner.

Additionally, to cause interference in the [[Lor Space]], one must first know what exactly the Lor is in order to cause significant interference. If a Lor is defined as 'downwards force increase' then one could interfere with it by identifying any of these keywords and scramble them, or by sending conflicting Lor such as 'decrease' or 'upwards force' which would make it so both forces get increased simultaneously.

Alternatively one could completely erase a Lor, but that requires the complete comprehension of the constructed Lor beforehand and to be able to actually perceive the Lor directly.

Jamming Lor, if able to be pulled off, is usually effective because the Lu practitioner will, in most cases, opt to cancel their own cast after noticing that someone has interfered with it in a meaningful way in order to avoid wasting their Lu and save time.
