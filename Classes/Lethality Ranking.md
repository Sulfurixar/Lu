# Lethality Ranking
Lu commands have different effects depending on the command. But one category which is measured is specific to marking how dangerous a command is for those affected by its area of effect. 

A Lethality rank of a command can change depending on the circumstances it was used in. For example, using a ramming command against a person may be Rank B in most circumstances, but if used inside a building, it could be elevated to Rank A as it could have an effect of collapsing the building if used in the correct place.

They are separated into 4 Classes:
	1) Rank A - Lethal;
	2) Rank B - Severe;
	3) Rank C - Damaging;
	4) Rand D - Safe.

## Rank A:
Lethal Zaak, or Zaak causing at least injuries resulting in death or permanent disability in the AOE.

## Rank B:
Zaak causing injuries resulting in lasting disability or a severe injury in the AOE.

## Rank C:
Zaak causing injuries resulting in temporary disability in the AOE.

## Rand D:
Zaak of which purpose is not to cause damage.
