# Practitioner
An individual who has begun researching their first [[Thema]] up to having mastered two [[Thema|Themas]].

Most Lu practitioners are of the Practitioner Rank.

## Spaan Form
Upon the mastery of their first [[Thema]], a practitioner gains access to their Spaan Form, which is a form of fortification using one the concepts of their mastered [[Thema|Themas]] as it's conceptual basis at a time. This must be trained and not all [[Thema|Themas]] are suited for this.

Some Glass Cannon Practitioners never acquire a Spaan form despite going to higher [[Practitioner Ranking|Practioner Rankings]].
