# Classes
Lu practitioner ability to wield Lu is spread into multiple sub-classifications which are then used to determine their General Class.

The sub-classifications are as follows:
	1) [[Lethality Ranking]];
	2) [[Area of Effect (AOE) Ranking]];
	3) [[Practitioner Ranking]];
	4) [[Casting Ranking]].

From those, the General Class is constructed by dividing all Practitioners by their [[Practitioner Ranking|Practitioner Rankings]], as such:
	1) [[Practitioner]];
	2) [[Trinity]];
	3) [[Septette]].
In each they are ordered by their [[Casting Ranking]], from highest to lowest, assigned a positive integer value from 1 to N, where N is the total number of practitioners in the [[Practitioner Ranking|Practitioner Rank]].

And using the stated method you could get a ranking as follows:
	[[Trinity]] Freya, 22; where [[Trinity]] refers to their [[Practitioner Ranking]] and 22 refers to the scale of their [[Casting Ranking]] in comparison to others of the same [[Practitioner Ranking]].

Additionally, further generalizations can be made such as High-[[Trinity]], Mid-[[Trinity]], Low-[[Trinity]] to shorten it to: Mid-[[Trinity]] Freya or Mid-[[Trinity]] Freya, 22 - to further indicate whether their position is high, mid or low in their [[Practitioner Ranking|Practitioner Rank]].
