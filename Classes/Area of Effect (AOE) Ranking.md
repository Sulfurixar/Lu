# Area of Effect Ranking
Not all Lu commands affect the same scale of an area. For most purposes, scale is measured in the size of how many people it could potentially affect in a single cast. Typically, the AOE Ranking of a command does not change.

They are separated into 6 Classes:
	1) Trivial;
	2) Individual;
	3) Combat;
	4) Tactical;
	5) Strategic;
	6) Catastrophic.

## Trivial Class:
Zaak with the power to affect an area smaller than a person.

## Individual Class:
Zaak with the power to affect the area of typically one person.

## Combat Class:
Zaak with the power to affect a small group, typically 2-5 people.

## Tactical Class:
Zaak with the power to affect large groups (5-15 people) or mobile vehicles.

## Strategic Class:
Zaak with the power to affect an entire settlement or fleet with a single cast.

## Catastrophy Class:
Zaak with the power to affect a large city or country.
