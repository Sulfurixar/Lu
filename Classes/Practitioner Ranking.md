# Practitioner Ranking
To distinguish between practitioners' potential danger level, a set of milestones were observed, where practitioners who hadn't accomplished them and who had had a significant difference in their ability to sustain the effects of their Zaak and also the intricacies of how they would use their Themas.

They are separated into 3 main classes, with some sub-classes specifying their progression through specified class:
	1) [[Practitioner]] - No mastery over a single [[Thema]];
		1) 1-[[Practitioner]] - Can use 1 [[Thema]];
		2) Spaan 1-Practitioner - Can use the [[Practitioner|Spaan Form]];
		3) (Spaan) 2-[[Practitioner]] - Can use 2 [[Thema|Themas]] and maybe [[Practitioner|Spaan Form]];
	2) [[Trinity]] - Can use 3 [[Thema|Themas]] and [[Practitioner|Spaan Form]] and has mastered at least 1 of the [[Thema|Themas]];
		1) 4-[[Trinity]] - Can use 4 [[Thema|Themas]];
		2) Astral 4-[[Trinity]] - Can use the [[Trinity|Trinity Form]];
		3) (Astral) 5-[[Trinity]] - Can use 5 [[Thema|Themas]] and maybe [[Trinity|Trinity Form]];
		4) Astral 6-[[Trinity]] - Can use 6 [[Thema|Themas]] and maybe [[Trinity|Trinity Form]];
	3) [[Septette]] - Can use 7 [[Thema|Themas]], [[Trinity|Trinity Form]] and has matered at least 3 of the [[Thema|Themas]].
