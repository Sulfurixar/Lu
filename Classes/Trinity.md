# Trinity

Achieved when one has mastered 1 [[Thema]] and can use at least 3 [[Thema|Themas]] in total.

Normally it takes many years to a decade to accomplish.

## Trinity Enhance Mode
Once achieved, a new Trinity enhance mode becomes available to be learned for the practitioner. This mode gives the practitioner more control over the [[Lor Space]], allowing them to support each of the [[Thema|Themas]] they've learned with the other [[Thema|Themas]] they have to reach a grander effect. In this way, it becomes apparent that deciding which [[Thema|Themas]] one learns can have drastic effects on their ability depending on how well their [[Thema|Themas]] synergize.

## Synergy Pitfall
Some people think they're smart and decide to focus on learning [[Thema|Themas]] they know have very good synergy in order to maximise the results of their research. However, what they may not realize is that even though they picked topics with good synergy, they may not have any predisposition to being able to master them, thus leading to stunted growth and decades of wasted time.

## Trinity Form

Upon mastering 3 [[Thema|Themas]], they gain the ability to learn the Trinity Form which is a passive large scale Zaak overwriting effect that uses the concepts of their [[Thema|Themas]] as its basis.
