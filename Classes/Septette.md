# Septette

Achieved when one can use 7 [[Thema|Themas]] and has mastered 3 of them.

Maybe one in a billion reaches this level of Mastery.

Up to [[Trinity]], learning [[Thema|Themas]] is not too difficult because you only have to master 3 concepts and how they synergize. But with each addition of a [[Thema]], the difficulty curve gets exponentially worse when trying to synergize [[Thema|Themas]], which is what becoming a [[Trinity]] and Septette is all about.

There has been no Septette thus far who didn't own a Legendary Grimoire.
